    "descripcion" => "In its initial stages, San Miguel of Ilobasco was only a small group of poor indigenous people settled around a church and a couple of soldiers called lancers established in the same public building. It was, first of all, to pacify the region that potentially had much to offer in the production of indigo. In 1550 Ilobasco had about 1,100 inhabitants and was one of the most important Indian populations of the region. It currently has a population of approximately 61,510 people who are dedicated to livestock, corn farming, trade and pottery, the latter being one of the most important. 
    
     In actuality, Ilobasco is known throughout the national territory because of the art of manufacturing, a trade that in turn has given the town the name of doll town. But Ilobasco also, since long ago, has stood out for its busy trade, since as of today it’s not strange for anyone since the city is defined as a place of commerce.",

There was a time in Ilobasco when the indigo merchants came to buy the harvest beforehand. Long before the first emigrants would settle, the existing farms had been dedicated 70% to the production of indigo. These were the possible motivations that the emigrants had to settle down in later times, simply with the desire to dedicate themselves to the cultivation of this product and later to establish themselves as an economic force.",

For more than 300 years, the place was a bridge between the merchants, first indigenous people and later Spaniards and criollos. The place was not very pleasant to live because of the humid climate. However, over the years, Ilobasco increased its population growth, until achieving the data obtained from its current population.",
    "agriculturatitle" => "Farming", 
    "agriculturadesc" => "Within the zone, the agricultural activity is oriented towards the cultivation of cotton, sugarcane and livestock. The cotton has marketing facilities because it is close to this area, a benefit of the cotton cooperative. Also, for the production of sugarcane, processing industries are located within the area, and is also a crop that has a good transport system between the production unit and the mill. In this area milk and meat cattle ranching takes place, and that is where the most technified farms in the country are located. Over there, the Sonsonate milk cooperative is located as well, which buys its product from dairy farmers and then commercializes it."
