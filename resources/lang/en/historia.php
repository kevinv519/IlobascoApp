In all the territory of which at the moment it constitutes the department of Cabins, was occupied by the Lenca and conquered at the end of century XV by the pipiles. Its etymology is, therefore: “place of sweet corn tortillas”. During the colonial period its name was written in different ways: Gilovasco, ilobasco, Xilobasco. So it is clarified that the syllable “bas” or “vas”  was corruption originated by Castilian phonetics."
